# Sentiment Analysis of Public Opinion using Twitter Data
## Introduction

This project aims to analyze public sentiment using Twitter data. We'll build a machine learning model to classify tweets as expressing positive, negative, or neutral sentiments towards these vaccines. The insights gained can potentially help public health agencies understand public concerns and tailor their communication strategies.

## Data

**-Description:** We'll collect tweets containing "COVID-19 vaccine" or "coronavirus vaccine" from the past six months.

**-Format:** The data will be retrieved from the Twitter API in JSON format. Each tweet object will include text, user information, and creation time.

**-Collection:** We'll use the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter API, filtering tweets based on the chosen keywords and date range.

## Preprocessing

**-Cleaning:** We'll remove irrelevant characters (e.g., punctuation, URLs), lowercase the text, and remove mentions (@ usernames) and hashtags. We might also consider addressing emojis and emoticons by converting them to sentiment-laden text or removing them altogether.
**-Tokenization:** We'll tokenize the text into individual words using the NLTK library's TweetTokenizer, specifically designed to handle Twitter-specific language.
**Normalization:** We might explore stemming (reducing words to their base form) using NLTK's PorterStemmer to potentially improve model generalizability.

## Feature Engineering

**-Text Representation:** We'll employ TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to represent each tweet as a numerical vector, capturing the importance of words based on their frequency within a tweet and rarity across the entire dataset.
**-Additional Features (Optional):** We might consider incorporating sentiment lexicon scores (using libraries like VADER or TextBlob) as additional features to complement the TF-IDF representation.

## Model Selection

**-Algorithm:** We'll train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for sentiment analysis. SVMs are well-suited for text classification tasks due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and perform well with limited training data.
**-Evaluation Metrics:** We'll evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class (positive, negative, neutral).

## Training and Evaluation

**-Train/Test Split:** We'll split the data into an 80/20 train-test split, ensuring the class distribution is balanced in both sets using stratified sampling.
**-Model Training:** We'll use sci-kit-learn to train the SVM model, tuning hyperparameters like the kernel function and cost parameters to optimize performance. We'll also employ techniques like grid search or randomized search to find the best hyperparameter combination.
**-Model Evaluation:** We'll evaluate the trained model on the testing set using the chosen metrics. The results will be presented in a table and a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance on each sentiment class.

## Deployment (Optional)
**-Serving:** If desired, we can create a web API using Flask or another framework to deploy the model as a sentiment analysis service. Tweets can be submitted to the API for real-time sentiment classification.
**Monitoring:** We'll monitor the deployed model's performance over time, tracking metrics like accuracy and identifying potential biases or concept drift (changes in language usage over time) that might necessitate retraining.

## Further Exploration

**-Error Analysis:** We'll analyze misclassified tweets to understand the model's weaknesses. This could involve examining tweets with incorrect sentiment labels and refining the training data or exploring different classification algorithms.
**-Ensemble Methods:** We might investigate ensemble methods, such as combining predictions from multiple SVM models with different hyperparameter settings, to potentially achieve better overall performance.
**-Advanced Techniques:** In the future, we could explore deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which can effectively capture sequential information in text data and potentially improve sentiment analysis accuracy.
